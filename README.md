# Windows-7-Simulator

Just some project I have been working on for the past 5 Months Made completly in Haxe
Its very broken Right Now as haxe isn't the best engine out there but is the only one I can code Right Now so bugs are to be expected so be aware that there are to many bugs I will try to fix it ASAP.

#WARNING!!!

Currently supported resolution is 1920 x 1080 Flixel does not have a feature that would make the game have universal resolution (Or I just don't know about it yet which is more possible then it not existing).
